# Simon Says Game

Welcome to the Simon Says game! Test your memory and concentration skills with this classic memory challenge. Follow Simon's lead as he shows you a sequence of colors, and it's your task to repeat the pattern by clicking the buttons in the same order.

## How to Play

1. **Memorize**: Simon will begin by showing you a sequence of colors. Pay close attention to the order in which the buttons light up.

2. **Repeat**: Once Simon finishes the sequence, it's your turn! Click the buttons in the exact order that Simon showed you.

3. **Advance to the Next Round**: If you successfully reproduce the sequence, congratulations! Simon will add one more color to the pattern for the next round, increasing the challenge.

4. **Keep Going**: The game continues as long as you keep correctly repeating the sequences.

5. **Challenge Yourself**: See how far you can go without making a mistake! Can you beat your own record?
